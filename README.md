ML MODEL

What is Time Series Forecasting?
It is the process of using past data (measured over time) to predict future values using different time series models.

What are we doing here?
Training a SARIMAX Model on the existing dataset and then predict the temperature values for the same dataset and find error differences.
WHY SARIMAX?
⦁	Can easily handle seasonality
⦁	Suitable for hourly, daily forecasting methods
⦁	Has Non-Seasonal(p,d,q) and Seasonal(P,D,Q,S) values and additional exogenous variables(like time,wind).
